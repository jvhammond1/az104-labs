**What are Azure Resource Locks?**  
Azure resource locks provide a way to safeguard critical Azure resources by preventing accidental deletion or modification. Unlike RBAC, which controls *who* can do *what*, locks enforce restrictions *regardless of role*.

There are two types:
- `CanNotDelete` (Delete Lock): Resource can be read or modified, but not deleted.
- `ReadOnly`: Resource can be read only â€” no modifications or deletions allowed.

These appear in the Azure Portal as **Delete** and **Read-only**.
