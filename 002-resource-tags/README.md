### ðŸ“š Key Concepts

**What is a Virtual Machine?**  
A virtual machine (VM) simulates a complete computer system, including CPU, memory, and storage, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single host. Itâ€™s isolated from the host system and other VMs.

**What is a Tag?**  
Tags in Azure are name/value pairs that help organize resources logically.  
Example: `Environment=Production`, `CostCenter=Accounting`

Tags can be applied to:
- Resources (e.g., VMs)
- Resource Groups
- Subscriptions
