In this lab we will walk through the steps on how to set tags on resources.

Introduction
What is a Virtual Machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). VMs allow multiple different operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer. A VM provides an environment that is isolated from the rest of a system, so whatever is running inside a VM wonâ€™t interfere with anything else running on the host hardware.

What is a tag?
You apply tags to your Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions to logically organize them into a taxonomy. Each tag consists of a name and a value pair. For example, you can apply the name Environment and the value Production to all the resources in production.
