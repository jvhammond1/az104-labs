Lab Details
In this lab we will walk through the steps on how to set alerts on resources if they are over consumed or on other scenarios.

Introduction
What is a Virtual Machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). VMs allow multiple different operating systems to run simultaneously on a single computer.

A VM provides an environment that is isolated from the rest of a system, so whatever is running inside a VM wonâ€™t interfere with anything else running on the host hardware.

What is an Alert in Azure?
Alerts proactively notify you when issues are found with your infrastructure or application using your monitoring data in Azure Monitor. They allow you to identify and address issues before the users of your system notice them.

Metric alerts in Azure Monitor provide a way to get notified when one of your metrics crosses a threshold. Metric alerts work on a range of multi-dimensional platform metrics, custom metrics, Application Insights standard and custom metrics.
